The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties Between States and International Organizations or Between International Organizations (VCLTIO) is an international treaty that regulates the formation, interpretation, application, amendment, termination and invalidity of treaties involving international organizations. It was drafted by the International Law Commission and opened for signature on 21 March 1986. However, it has not yet entered into force, as it requires ratification or accession by 35 states. As of October 2022, only 33 states have ratified or acceded to the Convention. [^1^]
 
The VCLTIO is an extension of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) of 1969, which deals with treaties between states. It recognizes the legal capacity of international organizations to conclude treaties, which is necessary for the exercise of their functions and the fulfilment of their purposes. It also distinguishes between states and international organizations in using terminology, such as ratification and formal confirmation. It also addresses some specific issues related to treaties involving international organizations, such as their relation to the member states and their constituent instruments. [^2^]

It can also help to enhance legal order and peaceful cooperation in international relations. However, it is important to note that the VCLTIO does not affect those relations between an international organization and its members that are regulated by the rules of the organization. [^3^]

- *The Law of Treaties Beyond the Vienna Convention*, edited by Enzo Cannizzaro (Oxford University Press, 2011). This book offers a comprehensive analysis of the law of treaties as it emerges from the interplay between the 1969 Vienna Convention and customary international law. It revisits the basic concepts underlying the provisions of the Vienna Convention, so as to determine the actual state of the law and its foreseeable development. It also examines some of the most controversial aspects of treaty interpretation, such as the role of travaux prÃƒÂ©paratoires, special meaning and subsequent practice. It also addresses some of the specific issues related to treaties involving international organizations, such as their legal personality, treaty-making capacity and responsibility.
- *Treaties and Subsequent Practice*, edited by Georg Nolte (Oxford University Press, 2013). This book explores how subsequent practice can be used as a means of interpretation or modification of treaties. It examines both general aspects of subsequent practice under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and specific cases of subsequent practice concerning particular fields of international law, such as human rights, international humanitarian law, environmental law and investment law. It also considers how subsequent practice affects treaties involving international organizations, such as their membership, powers and functions.
- *The Oxford Guide to Treaties*, edited by Duncan B. Hollis (Oxford University Press, 2012).

It also deals with specific types of treaties, such as multilateral treaties, human rights treaties and treaties involving international organizations. It also offers practical guidance on treaty research and drafting.
